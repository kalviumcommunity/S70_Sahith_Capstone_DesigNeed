# DesigNeed

## Overview
DesigNeed is a platform that bridges the gap between brands and designers. Brands can post design requirements (like logos, social media content, packaging, etc.), and designers can pitch their ideas. The platform streamlines the design collaboration process, allowing brands to browse designer portfolios, provide feedback, and choose the best design.

## Features
- Designer and brand user roles
- Design listing and pitch submission
- File upload functionality
- JWT and third-party authentication
- Mood board creation
- Real-time feedback and collaboration tools
